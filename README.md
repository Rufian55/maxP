# maxP

Project that determines the maximum sum of a subarray as input via a textfile of ints seperated by spaces, as many lines as you like.  The program will process each line of the textfile and determine and report both the maximum sum of the subarray and the values that make up the subarray.  A seperate textfile is written to each program run for each line of the inputted textfile.

Additionally, the program runs with four different versions of the maximum sum subarray algorithm, including naive, naive improved, recursive, and itertive with various running times.  These running times are collected and reported for analysis via curve fitting, etc. [done elsewhere.]
